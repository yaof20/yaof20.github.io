I am final-year master student of the Computational Law Program (Joint Program of CS & Law) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm). I am
supervised by Prof. [Weixing Shen](https://oxcaigg.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/weixing-shen/) and Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dT0v5u0AAAAJ&hl), 
working on Natural Language Processing and Legal Intelligence.

My research interests generally lie in deep learning methods on NLP and their applications in the legal 
domain. Specifically, I am working on Information Extraction and Information Retrieval on legal documents. My research goal is to extract information and distill knowledge from the large-scale unstructured legal documents and build practical Legal AI applications, reducing the workload for legal professionals and realizing the vision of equal access to justice for all.
